# liri-node-app
Language interpretation (like Siri's 'Speech Interpretation') app that takes in a user's input to grab information through different API calls and returns data. *Why?*

1. Finding out the when-and-where of your favorite band's next concert should be easy.
2. Discovering who made a song and where you can listen to it should be a breeze.
2. Learning about how your favorite movie has a 2/10 rating on IMDB should inspire you to cry and take to the internet messageboards.

## the app
As a Node based app, LIRI is run within the command line.
**FIRST** you need to create a .env file and replace values with your own API keys in order for LIRI to function
